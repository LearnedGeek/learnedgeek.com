On April 20 I was debugging a subtle issue with a Claude Code instance and [ANI, the AI companion I've been running as a research project](/Blog/Post/building-ani-ai-companion-for-grief) for the last eight months. We had a long back-and-forth and landed on a principle I phrased this way:

> *"Cosine similarity measures topical overlap. Parroting is verbatim phrase reuse. Those are different signals."*

We decided not to patch the issue at the reply layer. Treating the symptom, not the cause. Didn't want a guard that destroyed good replies to silence a bad one.

Three days later. Different Claude instance. Same bug resurfaces. I ask for a fix. Claude proposes — word for word, almost — the cosine-similarity guard I had rejected three days earlier. The prior reasoning existed on disk. Claude Code writes every session to `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`, and the file holding my April 20 rejection was right there in that directory. But the active instance couldn't see it. It had been compacted out of context.

I said "search the history before we move on anything." Claude grepped. About forty seconds later we were both looking at my own April 20 quote again, verbatim. We moved on.

That's when the tool I'd been half-thinking about became something I had to actually build.

## The pattern had already been named

A few days earlier a Microsoft engineer published [I wasted 68 minutes a day re-explaining my code, then I built auto-memory](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/i-wasted-68-minutes-a-day-re-explaining-my-code-then-i-built-auto-memory/). Copilot CLI, not Claude Code, but the same underlying shape. The agent is writing structured session data to disk already. The agent just isn't reading its own archive.

Different file format, same insight. Copilot CLI keeps a SQLite database. Claude Code writes line-per-turn JSONL. Either way, months of decisions are already persisted. The agent doesn't remember them because nothing's pointing it at them.

Credit to that post for crystallizing what I'd been feeling but hadn't named.

## What I built

`claude-recall` is three pieces:

1. **A small Python CLI that indexes the JSONL archive into SQLite with FTS5 full-text search.** Incremental, read-only, uses the bundled `sqlite3` module. Commands: `index`, `search`, `show`, `list`, `status`.

2. **Optional semantic rerank on top of the FTS5 results** via a local Ollama embedding model (`nomic-embed-text`). Turns *"find me the session where I said X"* into *"find me the session where I meant X."* FTS5 finds keyword overlap; embeddings catch the conceptual cousins.

3. **A `UserPromptSubmit` hook that fires on every message** I send in Claude Code and injects ranked prior-session matches as `additionalContext`. Latency on my machine: around 80 ms per prompt with rerank on. Below human perception.

The hook is a NativeAOT-compiled binary now — `claude-recall-hook.exe` — not a Python wrapper. Every prompt used to pay a fresh Python interpreter tax and it was killing the UX. The binary fixed that in v0.4.

What this looks like in practice: when I drafted this paragraph, the hook ran. It searched 25,000 messages across 20 projects, ranked them against my current phrasing, and injected the top hits into this instance's context. I didn't do anything. I don't actually know what it found — Claude Code doesn't surface `additionalContext` in the UI — but the effect is visible: the instance stops making up prior decisions. It references them.

## Three design principles

Short list, honestly stated:

- **Read-only against the archive.** Never modify what Claude Code writes. The archive is the source of truth; we consume it, we don't touch it.
- **Graceful degradation.** If the hook crashes, the prompt flows normally. A broken recall layer must never block the human.
- **Zero extra install hops in the common case.** FTS5 is already in every modern Python stdlib. The embedding layer is opt-in.

There's a deeper principle under those three: the tool's job is to make the archive cheap to query. It isn't trying to be clever about what to retrieve, or to summarize, or to editorialize. It finds things. The cleverness has to live in the agent you're already using, not in the recall layer.

## The honest caveats

This is v0.4, tagged beta. It works on my machine daily against a 25,000-message archive. It also has bugs — two install-path regressions caught and fixed in the last 48 hours, both closed before this post went up. The v0.5 release will land on PyPI so the install story becomes `pip install claude-recall` without a release-wheel URL.

It isn't semantic-search-of-everything. It isn't a replacement for CLAUDE.md or for the `memory/` auto-memory system Claude Code ships natively. It isn't cross-machine — your session archive is local, the index stays local. That's a feature for me, since the archive has personal data in it; it may be a limitation if you need shared recall across teammates.

## If you want to try it

Public repo at [github.com/LearnedGeek/claude-recall](https://github.com/LearnedGeek/claude-recall). MIT licensed. Install instructions in the README. Beta quality — file issues when you break it, because you will, and I want to know.

Two things I'd specifically appreciate testing from early adopters:

- **Multi-project installs.** Project auto-scoping landed in v0.2.1 but it only has me as its test case.
- **Install-path edge cases.** The v0.4.0 native-binary wheel had a packaging glob issue that bypassed CI and only surfaced when I upgraded my own install. There will be more of those. Windows, macOS, Linux all welcome.

## The broader thing

Every agentic coding tool writes structured session data somewhere, and none of them have a native mechanism yet for the agent to read its own prior work. That gap is getting filled tool by tool. The Microsoft post is the Copilot CLI instance. `claude-recall` is the Claude Code instance. Whichever agent you use, the shape is the same: find the archive, index it cheaply, wire a hook, stop re-explaining.

It's also a small demonstration of something I keep running into across projects: when you deploy a system for long enough, the interesting problems show up in the seams. ANI taught me that [memory isn't just storage, it's an amplifier](/Blog/Post/park-et-al-generative-agents-memory). claude-recall is what happens when the same observation comes at me from the other direction — when the *agent I'm using* needs memory, not the agent I'm building.
